However, the score is constrained by recurring regulatory compliance challenges, specifically USFDA Warning Letters and 'Official Action Indicated' (OAI) classifications for key facilities (e.g., Pithampur Unit-2 in late 2025), which reflect operational oversight issues rather than financial malfeasance. Financial recovery is robust with improving ROE/ROCE and a net cash position."
