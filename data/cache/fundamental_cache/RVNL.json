      "reasoning": "Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL) is a 'Navratna' CPSE under the Ministry of Railways, ensuring high stability and adherence to government governance standards. While execution delays and lower margins in competitive bidding are concerns, the management has maintained a robust order book (>\u20b990,000 Cr) and is diversifying into global and non-railway projects. The low 3-year sales/profit growth (CAGR ~1-3%) contrasts with high market valuation, but the government backing provides a strong safety net."
