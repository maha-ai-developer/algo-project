The FY24 reported loss was due to a strategic 'kitchen-sinking' exercise (impairment of African assets) to clean up the balance sheet, a move management communicated clearly. The core business remains robust with high ROCE (excluding one-offs), and the professional management team (led by Sudhir Sitapati) is highly regarded."
