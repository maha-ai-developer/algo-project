While the company is in a turnaround phase with volatile profitability (reflected in the negative/high P/E and low ROE) due to high depreciation and interest costs post-demerger, revenue growth remains robust. A past SEBI adjudication regarding non-disclosure was technical and related to the pre-listing period, deemed not liable to the listed entity."
