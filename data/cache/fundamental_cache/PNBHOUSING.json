      "reasoning": "The company has demonstrated strong recovery in asset quality and profitability under its transformation strategy 'Projectignite'. While the sudden resignation of MD & CEO Girish Kousgi in July 2025 caused temporary volatility, the prompt appointment of seasoned veteran Ajai Kumar Shukla (ex-Tata Capital) in Dec 2025 has stabilized sentiment. Backing from Punjab National Bank and high institutional holding (approx 60%) supports a decent integrity score, though the leadership transition warrants monitoring."
