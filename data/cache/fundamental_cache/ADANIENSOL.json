However, the company operates with high leverage (Debt/Equity ~1.8) and has faced scrutiny regarding governance and ownership structures in the past (e.g., Hindenburg report), though recent regulatory outcomes have been favorable. The score reflects a balance between operational excellence and historical governance risks."
