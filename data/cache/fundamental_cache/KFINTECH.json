The company has demonstrated robust financial performance with healthy ROCE (~35%) and profit growth (~28% CAGR). Management has successfully pivoted towards international expansion and alternative asset classes to drive future growth (>20% guidance). High institutional holding (~47%) and a cash-rich balance sheet further support a high integrity score, though the stock trades at a premium valuation."
