      "reasoning": "SBI Cards is a subsidiary of the State Bank of India (SBI), ensuring high management integrity and stability. It is the second-largest credit card issuer in India, benefiting from a strong parentage and wide distribution network. While the company has shown robust sales growth (~19% CAGR), profit growth has been tempered (~6%) by rising credit costs and operating expenses. The negative Free Cash Flow is characteristic of a growing lending institution where capital is deployed to expand the loan book (receivables). The company faces short-term headwinds from slightly elevated NPAs (Net NPA ~1.42%) and cost of funds, but the long-term structural story remains intact due to low credit card penetration in India."
