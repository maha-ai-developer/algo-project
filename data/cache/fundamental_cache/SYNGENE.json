It is a leading integrated CRO/CDMO with a robust client base including top global pharma companies. While the company faces short-term headwinds due to a slowdown in US biotech funding (leading to single-digit growth guidance for FY25/FY26), its long-term fundamentals are secured by capacity expansions (e.g., Mangalore, Hyderabad) and a debt-free balance sheet (net cash position)."
