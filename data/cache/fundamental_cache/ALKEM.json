However, it faces standard pharmaceutical industry risks including USFDA regulatory observations and recent income tax disputes (disallowance of deduction claims worth ~Rs 375 Cr). Management has guided for reasonable growth (10% CAGR) and is expanding into CDMO and biosimilars. The promoter holding is significant, though slightly decreased recently."
