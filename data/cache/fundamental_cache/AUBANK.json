The bank has demonstrated robust 3-year sales growth (~39% CAGR) and profit growth (~23% CAGR). Despite a high P/E of 34x, the premium is supported by its high growth trajectory and transition to a universal bank. Asset quality remains managed with Net NPA around 0.6%, though some stress in unsecured portfolios exists. Governance is considered strong with no major recent scandals."
