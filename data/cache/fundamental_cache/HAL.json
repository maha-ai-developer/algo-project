The company boasts a pristine balance sheet with zero debt and a massive cash surplus (~\u20b944,000 Cr). Recent execution has improved significantly, supported by a record order book exceeding \u20b92 lakh crore. Key risks remain bureaucratic hurdles and single-customer dependency (Indian Armed Forces), but the 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' push provides long-term structural tailwinds."
