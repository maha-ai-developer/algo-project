The bank is successfully navigating a turnaround with improving asset quality (GNPA reduced to ~3.8% in FY24) and shifting focus towards secured lending (targeting 50% secured book by FY26). The extremely high 3-year profit growth (177%) reflects a recovery from a low base in FY22 caused by high provisioning. Management guidance remains optimistic with ~20% growth projections."
