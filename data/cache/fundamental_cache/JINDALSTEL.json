However, the company has demonstrated strong operational execution, becoming a low-cost steel producer with significant capacity expansion (Angul). Recent financial reports have unmodified audit opinions, and the management has successfully deleveraged the balance sheet significantly from peak debt levels, although a new capex cycle has begun. The score reflects a balance between historical governance concerns and recent professional management performance."
