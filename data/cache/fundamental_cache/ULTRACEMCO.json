      "reasoning": "UltraTech Cement is the flagship company of the Aditya Birla Group, known for high corporate governance standards. Management has successfully executed a massive capacity expansion strategy (aiming for 200 MTPA) while maintaining a healthy balance sheet. Despite the capital-intensive nature of the business and aggressive capex (which currently suppresses FCF), the company maintains a dominant market leadership position in India. The management's focus on cost efficiencies, green energy adoption, and strategic acquisitions (like India Cements and Kesoram) demonstrates strong long-term vision and execution capabilities."
