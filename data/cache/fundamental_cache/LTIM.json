The merger between L&T Infotech and Mindtree has been executed with strategic clarity. Financial reporting is detailed and consistent. The company maintains a healthy balance sheet with negative net debt and robust cash flows, typical of top-tier IT services firms. The slight moderation in recent growth figures reflects broader sector headwinds rather than internal governance issues."
