The recent transition to a new technology platform developed by TCS (Project Udaan) marks a significant shift, aimed at reducing long-term costs and reliance on previous vendors, despite initial delays. Governance is overseen by SEBI, ensuring high compliance standards. The high P/E reflects market optimism about its scalable, asset-light business model."
