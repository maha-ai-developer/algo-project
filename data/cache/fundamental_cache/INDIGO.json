      "reasoning": "InterGlobe Aviation (IndiGo) commands a dominant market share (>60%) in the Indian aviation sector, driven by high operational efficiency and a low-cost carrier model. The company's financials show a strong post-COVID recovery with high ROE (82.19%), though this is significantly leveraged by lease liabilities (Debt/Equity ~8.66). The management is professionally run and highly regarded for operational excellence and governance, despite previous promoter disagreements. The large gap between ROE and ROCE (13.07%) highlights the impact of leverage. Future growth is projected to be robust (14%+) given the expanding Indian aviation market."
