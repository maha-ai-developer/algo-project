      "reasoning": "Oberoi Realty is a premium brand with a strong reputation for quality and timely delivery in the Mumbai market. The management, led by Vikas Oberoi, has maintained a clean balance sheet and high corporate governance standards compared to peers. While there have been minor litigations (common in real estate) and a recent FIR related to a joint venture dispute, the company's transparency, 'Zero GST' customer-centric initiatives, and high promoter holding (67.7%) reflect strong alignment with shareholder interests. The consistent financial performance and prudent capital allocation further support a high integrity score."
