      "reasoning": "IRFC is a 'Miniratna' PSU under the Ministry of Railways, effectively serving as the dedicated financing arm of the Indian Railways. It operates on a low-risk, cost-plus leasing model with a sovereign guarantee on its receivables, ensuring zero Non-Performing Assets (NPAs). Management integrity is considered high due to government backing and stringent oversight. The company enjoys a monopoly in its niche, though its growth is entirely dependent on the Indian Railways' capex cycles. The tax rate is currently effectively nil due to specific exemptions/structures."
