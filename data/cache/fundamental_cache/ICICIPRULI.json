      "reasoning": "ICICI Prudential Life Insurance is a leading private insurer in India with strong parentage (ICICI Bank & Prudential Plc). Traditional valuation metrics like P/E (72.5x) appear high, which is typical for life insurers where Embedded Value (EV) and Value of New Business (VNB) are preferred indicators. The 3-year profit growth (16%) is robust, though sales growth (premium income) has been moderate (4.5%). The company focuses on improving its VNB margin and product mix. Note: For DCF inputs, Net Profit is used as a proxy for Free Cash Flow, as standard FCF is often negative or volatile for insurers due to investment float and regulatory capital requirements."
