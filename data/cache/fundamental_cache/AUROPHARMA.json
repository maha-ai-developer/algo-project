In December 2025, the USFDA issued a Form 483 with 5 procedural observations for its APL Healthcare Unit-IV. While the company clarifies these are procedural and not data integrity issues, repeated regulatory scrutiny impacts the score. However, there are no reports of major financial fraud or promoter malfeasance recently, and the company maintains a dominant position in the US generics market."
