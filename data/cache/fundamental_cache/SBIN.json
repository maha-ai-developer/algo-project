Management has successfully navigated asset quality cycles, reducing GNPA to multi-year lows (~2.07%) and driving digital transformation via YONO. Despite being a PSU, it has shown robust profit growth (CAGR ~36%) and improved ROE (~16%+). Governance is overseen by a central board with RBI nomination, ensuring high integrity, though operational agility can be constrained by regulations compared to private peers."
