It boasts a debt-free balance sheet, high return ratios (ROE > 35%, ROCE > 50%), and a cash-rich position (Net Debt is negative). However, as a PSU, it is subject to government policy risks (e.g., convenience fee sharing). Management integrity is generally considered high within the PSU framework, though bureaucratic."
