      "reasoning": "Management led by Dilip Shanghvi is generally regarded as competent, having built a global generic pharma giant. However, the company faced significant corporate governance scrutiny in 2018-2019 regarding related party transactions (Aditya Medisales) and whistleblower complaints, which led to a SEBI forensic audit and a settlement in 2021. Since then, the company has taken corrective measures, simplified its structure, and reduced related-party exposure. Recent years have been stable with no major new governance red flags, but the past incidents weigh slightly on the score."
