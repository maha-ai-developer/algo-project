Recently, the company has received upgrades in ESG ratings (CDP A- score) and maintained stable credit outlooks, signaling improved governance perception. However, the company carries a 'Management Integrity Score' of 6 due to lingering historic concerns regarding group-level leverage and governance controversies (e.g., Hindenburg report), despite proactive debt reduction and transparency initiatives."
