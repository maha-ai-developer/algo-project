The company successfully executed a turnaround from losses to profitability in FY2025, demonstrating strong operational leverage. Management, led by founders Yashish Dahiya and Alok Bansal, retains high credibility with significant institutional backing (FIIs/DIIs hold >70%). Balance sheet is robust with zero debt and substantial cash reserves. Minor regulatory enquiries are typical for the fintech sector and do not indicate systemic governance issues."
