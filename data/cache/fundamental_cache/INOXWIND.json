While the company has executed a significant turnaround in FY25 (moving from loss to profit) and reduced net debt substantially, historical issues with financial statement quality and the complex recent merger/restructuring prevent a higher score. The management's focus on clearing un-commissioned inventory and securing a robust order book is a positive indicator."
